    An average, boring apple. Not much to say for flavor. Slightly sweet, slightly tart, 
    mostly just mild overall. Tastes like unsweetened applesauce. Similar to the 
    Fuji but without the disgustingly overpowering, in-your-face sweetness. Thick 
    skin but not too chewy. The texture of this one was unique. Somewhat mealy 
    and grainy, but the bite starts snappy. Not one I'd buy unless you like 
    apples with ignorable flavor.

    Bland, mushy, horrible flavor. Tastes like a bomb of white sugar with no depth.
    FAR too sweet. Aftertaste lingered for nearly an hour. Makes me sad.

    This is a really good sweet apple, but it still has enough tart flavor to
    keep me interested. Super crispy and snappy, like the name suggests. No
    weird aftertaste. Has some pleasant flavors in the back that I can't place.

    Super bland apart from an off, sickening taste, like honey if you took away
    all the sweetness. Tastes like a bland, unripe pear. Also has an odd bitter and 
    chemically flavor. The texture is average, skin is fine. The flesh is oddly yellow.

    Apple is a bit unusual, but the texture is wonderful. Skin not too chewy, with a good 
    crisp bite. But the flavor? It's slightly tart, but mostly sweet. Almost too sweet.
    Weird chemical fruit flavor and bitterness. Tastes somewhat artificial to me. 
    It could be so good, but that flavor is not pleasant.

    Not bad, not great. Average. Too mushy for my taste, and the skin is a 
    little chewy. Redeemingly, the skin does have a pop when you bite, as if 
    it were stretched tight over the apple. The flavor is predominantly tart, but
    it has a decent amount of sweetness. Would be great if it weren't so soft 
    and the skin weren't so tough. <ul>Elle Lowe, Visiting Critic: "It tasted like 
    green apple candy, and transported me to Halloween."</ul>

    An amazing and very flavorful apple. I had two today, and there was a 
    lot of variation. The first one was punchy and tart with a decent 
    sweetness. Crispy and very tasty. A new favorite for sure. The second 
    one was even more crispy, but the sour flavor was almost completely gone and 
    replaced wholly by sweet. A very good apple. Also, a pretty apple. I 
    preferred the intense first apple, but the second one was still on par with 
    some of the better sweet apples I've had a chance to taste. (After finishing
    the bag, I can say that the rest were as good as the first.)

    It's alright. Moderate crunch. Very dense and juicy. Sweet in some bites, 
    bland in others, and occasionally bitter, maybe from the skin. The skin is also 
    slightly tough.

    A good choice for sweet apple fans. Excellent styrofoam crunch and decent 
    skin. Delicate sweet flavor. A honey aftertaste. As tasty as it is beautiful.
    For the price, I find the Envy slightly underwhelming.

    Not good. Mushy with a tough skin. Not very sweetie. Bland.

    You know what a Gala tastes like. Eh. Soft and boring.

    Overrated and underwhelming. Not as sweet as the name would imply.

    Very crisp indeed. Extra points for consistency. It
    has nearly the perfect juicy and crispy texture, but I just wish it would
    pack a little bit more flavor. It needs more sour flavors and more depth
    with the sweetness. Still my stable staple.

    Probably what Granny Smith was like before she turned an old sour hag.
