        Spotting this apple in the store was a wonderful surprise. An early 
        Christmas gift from Lucy. I had just reviewed the Lucy Glo and found myself
        dissatisfied. This was meant to be—a second chance. The first
        noticeable difference is the intense redness of the skin. Inside, the apple 
        is splotched with red and pink, more so than the Glo. The texture is on the 
        crunchy, chewy side. The skin is as nice as it looks, with a subtle snap 
        that backs away to let the apple through. Mainly tart, but with an aftertaste 
        of subdued sweetness and cherry that lingers on the back of the tongue. 
        Sadly, the second Rose I tasted was garbage. The original review remains
        unchanged as a gracious demonstration of _the benefit of the doubt_.
  
          - Elle Lowe, Visiting Critic: "Tasted like pink and has a perfumey
        note, sweeter in the pink bits. The girliest of apples."

        Being a hybrid of the dependable Honeycrisp and the deplorable Fuji, I
        had uncertain expectations tasting this apple. Overall, I was pleasantly
        surprised at the Evercrisp's ability to rise above the generational 
        disappointment in its paternal line. Fortunately, it inherits an excellent 
        texture and decent-enough flavor from the other side. Crisp and crunchy, 
        with just enough acid to balance out a familiar, sweet, and still-lingering 
        flavor.

        As I continue, later and later into the season, I wonder if it's not their 
        fault? Am I on a losing streak, or are these apples past their prime? 
        Should I feel guilty rating an innocent apple this low? We go on. Lucy 
        Glo was a second chance for apples of color. Certainly, it was better 
        than Kissabel R., but not enough. Just like before, an odd, crunchy, 
        jicama-like texture. This time, a sweeter flavor, not bad. You get 
        delicate notes of white grape and pear. A decent balance of sweetness 
        and acidity. Not a strong apple, I might say bland, but sometimes a bite 
        leaves an impression.

        An apple, red on the inside? If you've never seen a colorfully cored 
        specimen in your apple-eating journey, I should warn you, looks can be 
        deceiving. The first of two wild cards, Kissabel Rouge, impressed me with 
        its crimson skin and pink interior. However, despite its flair, the Rouge 
        is unsettlingly crunchy rather than crisp, chewy at the skin, and worst 
        of all, dully sour; a pair that shouldn't go together. I was no longer 
        impressed.

        Not quite the godly apple its name might imply. Everything about its
        muted, can't-decide-if-red-or-yellow skin, nonexistent scent, mealy
        flesh, and flat flavor leaves the immortality-seeking apple consumer
        wanting. Perhaps if you squint your mouth, you might taste just a sprinkle
        of honey and ambiguous apple. Not a drop of acid to be seen. To be fair, 
        this apple had been sitting in the fridge for longer than any apple deserves.

        Red? Yes. It has a gorgeous, deep, and consistent crimson hue. Delicious? No.
        The taste is barely present, only a hint. No depth of flavor,
        just a whisper of bland apple sweetness. The texture is soft and sad, with
        a bite more chewy than crispy, and a tough skin. The juciness is 
        a minor plus. But what of it? The red delicious should be 
        left behind in the produce bin.

        One look at an Opal is enough to know it's a special apple. Golden Delicious
        is a pale husk compared to its bright yellow progeny. Whether the
        russeting around the stem is a gross defect or an expression of natural
        beauty is up for debate. Sitting in a bag untouched, these apples
        beg to be eaten with their strong, fresh, and floral scent. Taking a bite,
        you'll immediately notice the juicy flesh and unique flavor. It's sweet,
        delicate, just a little sour, and noticeably reminiscent of pear. The sweetness
        takes on an almost creamy quality, like a ripe banana—or is that the yellow 
        getting in my head? The flavor is certainly muted, but not at all bland.
        There are great notes of other fruits, notably grapes, and a drizzle of honey. If 
        not for the slightly chewy skin and underwhelming texture, this apple would
        be a top contender, but its depth of flavor is still enough on its 
        own to set the Opal apart.

        This apple is very small and round, with a dark purple-red hue, striking against 
        the monotony of most grocery store apples. The flesh is light with a 
        slightly yellow-green color. Smells grassy and tart. Tastes like it smells, a standard 
        sour apple with just enough sweetness. Moderately crunchy, a little on 
        the soft and mealy side (no surprise for a McIntosh descendant). The juciness is 
        good, but the skin is very chewy. What it gains on the McIntosh with its
        firmer flesh, it loses very quickly with its leathery skin.

        There's not much to say about this very normal apple. A tall, orangish-red 
        fruit with small green lenticels. Almost no scent. Overall, very bland,
        and the little taste it has is grassy and bitter. The texture is mealy, 
        and the skin is tough. Some bites indicate potential
        for flavor, but hardly enough to be described. It also browns fast.

        Hunnyz stand out at first as a very prominently dotted apple. The 
        lenticels pop against its red-yellow skin. Take a bite, and at first, it's 
        crunchy and crisp. But then it gets chewy, almost as if the entire apple 
        was core. As a core eater myself, I'm not sure that's a bad thing, but 
        it's not great either. The skin is background noise next to the texture 
        of the flesh. A good comparison is Jicama, or a raw potato. To add to its 
        uniquness, the Hunnyz tastes much like red grape, and the aftertaste 
        lingers pleasantly.

        The Cortland has a wide, flattened shape, similar to the McIntosh. The skin is smooth 
        with vertical stripes in hues of red, ranging from a deep crimson to 
        orangish pinks on a canvas of yellow-green. Cutting through its tough skin, 
        you're met by remarkably pale white flesh.
        It's a juicy apple, although it inherits the mushy flesh of the McIntosh.
        The flavor is mostly tart, though notes of orange and cranberry are present.
        Its sweetness comes through at the end of the bite. In this particular specimen,
        one quarter stood out significantly sweeter. It tasted of honey, and the 
        flesh was chewier and less pale.

        An average, boring apple. Not much to say for flavor. Slightly sweet, slightly tart, 
        mostly just mild overall. Tastes like unsweetened applesauce. Similar to the 
        Fuji but without the disgustingly overpowering, in-your-face sweetness. Thick 
        skin but not too chewy. The texture of this one was unique. Somewhat mealy 
        and grainy, but the bite starts snappy. Not one I'd buy unless you like 
        apples with ignorable flavor.

        This is a really good sweet apple, but it still has enough tart flavor to
        keep me interested. Super crispy and snappy, like the name suggests. No
        weird aftertaste. Has some pleasant flavors in the back that I can't place.

        Super bland apart from an off, sickening taste, like honey if you took away
        all the sweetness. Tastes like a bland, unripe pear. Also has an odd bitter and 
        chemically flavor. The texture is average, skin is fine. The flesh is oddly yellow.

        Unlike the last review of the Rave apple, the specimen in question is 
        of the First Kiss variety, exclusively Minnesota-grown. The apple has a 
        visibly smooth skin, strong red with patches yellow-orange. Immediately
        upon cutting the apple in half, everyone in the room will get a smell
        of cider. It's easily the strongest-smelling apple I've encountered. The skin 
        is slightly tough, and the flesh has an average crunch, slightly chewy.
        The juciness is good, and the flavor is an okay balance of sweet and sour. 
        None of the chemical taste as in the Rave. Some of the cidery smell makes 
        its way to the flavor, but not much. This bag was a little mealy, but given
        that this is an early-ripening apple, I might have just been late.

        The Rave is a bit unusual, but the texture is wonderful. Skin not too chewy, with a good 
        crisp bite. But the flavor? It's slightly tart, but mostly sweet. Almost too sweet.
        Weird chemical fruit flavor and bitterness. Tastes somewhat artificial to me. 
        It could be so good, but that flavor is not pleasant.

        Not bad, not great. Average. Too mushy for my taste, and the skin is a 
        little chewy. Redeemingly, the skin does have a pop when you bite, as if 
        it were stretched tight over the apple. The flavor is predominantly tart, but
        it has a decent amount of sweetness. Would be great if it weren't so soft 
        and the skin weren't so tough.

        An amazing and very flavorful apple. I had two today, and there was a 
        lot of variation. The first one was punchy and tart with a decent 
        sweetness. Crispy and very tasty. A new favorite for sure. The second 
        one was even more crispy, but the sour flavor was almost completely gone and 
        replaced wholly by sweet. A very good apple. Also, a pretty apple. I 
        preferred the intense first apple, but the second one was still on par with 
        some of the better sweet apples I've had a chance to taste. (After finishing
        the bag, I can say that the rest were as good as the first.)

        It's alright. Moderate crunch. Very dense and juicy. Sweet in some bites, 
        bland in others, and occasionally bitter, maybe from the skin. The skin is also

        A decent choice for sweet apple fans. Not so much if you like flavor. 
        Excellent styrofoam crunch and okay skin. Delicate sweet flavor, which 
        can be too delicate, often bland. A honey aftertaste if you're lucky. 
        Not narly as tasty as it is beautiful. For the price, I find the 
        Envy slightly underwhelming.

        While at first I found the Honeycrisp overrated, underwhelming, and not 
        as sweet as the name would imply, Later honeycrisps have changed my mind. 
        A solid sweet-sour apple, and mostly consistent in quality. Only its basic 
        flavor keeps the honeycrisp from achieving a greater ranking.

        Very crisp indeed. Extra points for consistency. It
        has nearly the perfect juicy and crispy texture, but I just wish it would
        pack a little bit more flavor. It needs more sour flavors and more depth
        with the sweetness. Still my stable staple. Extra points for browning
