I hardly ever remember my dreams, and when I do, itâ€™s never much more than a simple image or an impression of some weird random moment. Endless questions follow. Where did the rest of the dream go, if it ever was? Where do I go? What does it mean that I never dream vividly? And of course, what could our dreams possibly mean? If I, like Orr, dreamt effectively, would reality become a haze of confusion and unfinished sentences?

George is like the jellyfish we watch in the beginning, completely at the will of the forces of the sea. His dreams are out of control, his psychiatrist is using his power, and he is too weak to do anything. He is beached on unfamiliar realities and weighed down by memories of past lives. The same voice that tells him to leave the world alone, that we lack the will, the vision, the goodness to play god, keeps him enslaved to a man who is himself a slave to power and his own utopian ideals.
