<p>Let this be the place to learn about the things I love.</p>
<p>Be it writings on my various interests, thoughts on books and philosophy, or a penmanship portfolio, I plan to collect the most worthwhile of my ramblings and give to them a life and a home on this website. I don&rsquo;t honestly expect that anyone will visit my creation, at least for a while, but it makes no difference either way. The website is secondary to my penmanship, reading, writing, and studying. It&rsquo;s only a new element and extension of what I have been doing and will continue to do. It&rsquo;s a place to gather, share, and publish my work; a looming force compelling myself to spend more time developing my passions; and a chance to hone an essential skill of communication: a skill that, like any other, requires endless practice. I want to bring everything together, in one place, where presentation and quality matters.</p>
<p>In the future I can see myself embracing the importance of sharing, educating, and creating things for the eyes of others. Now, however, I want to share, not for the sake of sharing but for the sake of the shared and the sharer, so that there may be a time in my future when I have something truly worth sharing, and that at that time, no lack of skill will get in the way. Perhaps I don&rsquo;t feel like I possess anything of that worth right now. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mistake me for a web developer. Take one look at the html—or even worse, the <a href="https://github.com/ericstmoore/ericstmoore.github.io">repo</a> this site is built from—and see. But if you&rsquo;re curious:</p>
<p>This is a free GitHub Pages site, built with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and linked to my custom domain. I started from a <a href="https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please">template</a>, but changed much to my liking. All posts are written in Markdown.</p>
<p>CSS and design inspiration from <a href="https://carlinigraphy.com">carlinigraphy.com</a>, <a href="https://pbanks.net">Parker Banks</a>, the <a href="https://1mb.club">1MB Club</a>, and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">this vulgar website</a>.</p>
