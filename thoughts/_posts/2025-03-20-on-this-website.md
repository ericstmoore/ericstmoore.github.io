Let this be the place to learn about the things I love. 

Be it writings on my various interests, thoughts on books and philosophy, or a penmanship portfolio, I plan to collect the most worthwhile of my ramblings and give to them a life and a home on this website. I don't honestly expect that anyone will visit my creation, at least for a while, but it makes no difference either way. The website is secondary to my penmanship, reading, writing, and studying. It's only a new element and extension of what I have been doing and will continue to do. It's a place to gather, share, and publish my work; a looming force compelling myself to spend more time developing my passions; and a chance to hone an essential skill of communication: a skill that, like any other, requires endless practice. I want to bring everything together, in one place, where presentation and quality matters.

In the future I can see myself embracing the importance of sharing, educating, and creating things for the eyes of others. Now, however, I want to share, not for the sake of sharing but for the sake of the shared and the sharer, so that there may be a time in my future when I have something truly worth sharing, and that at that time, no lack of skill will get in the way. Perhaps I don't feel like I possess anything of that worth right now. That's why I'm here.

## The Technical
Don't mistake me for a web developer. Take one look at the html&mdash;or even worse, the [repo](https://github.com/ericstmoore/ericstmoore.github.io) this site is built from&mdash;and see. But if you're curious:

This is a free GitHub Pages site, built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and linked to my custom domain. I started from a [template](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please), but changed much to my liking. All posts are written in Markdown.

CSS and design inspiration from [carlinigraphy.com](https://carlinigraphy.com), [Parker Banks](https://pbanks.net), the [1MB Club](https://1mb.club), and [this vulgar website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com).
